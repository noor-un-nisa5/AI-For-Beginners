# Chapter 2: What Can AI Do?

AI can perform many tasks that require human-like thinking. Here are some common examples:

**Understanding Language**: AI can read text, understand what it means, and even respond. When you type a question into a search engine, AI helps find the best answers. Chatbots that answer customer service questions use AI to understand what you're asking.

**Recognizing Images**: AI can look at photos and identify what's in them. Your phone's camera can detect faces and focus on them. Social media apps can suggest tags for people in your photos. Medical AI can examine X-rays to help doctors spot problems.

**Making Predictions**: AI looks at past data to predict the future. Weather apps use AI to forecast if it will rain tomorrow. Online stores use AI to predict what products you might want to buy based on what you've looked at before.

**Playing Games**: AI has learned to play complex games like chess and Go at superhuman levels. It can also play video games and even create strategies that human players never thought of.

**Driving Cars**: Self-driving cars use AI to see the road, recognize traffic signs, detect pedestrians, and make decisions about when to turn or stop.
