# Chapter 1: What is Artificial Intelligence?

## Welcome to the World of AI

Have you ever asked Siri a question? Used Google Maps to find directions? Or watched Netflix recommend a show you might like? If so, you've already used artificial intelligence, or AI for short.

AI is all around us, but many people find it mysterious or confusing. This book will help you understand what AI really is, how it works, and why it matters in your everyday life.

## What Does "Artificial Intelligence" Mean?

Let's break down the term:

**Artificial** means something made by humans, not natural. An artificial flower is made by people, while a real flower grows in nature.

**Intelligence** means the ability to learn, understand, and solve problems. Humans have intelligence. We can learn new skills, understand complex ideas, and figure out solutions to challenges.

When we put these words together, **Artificial Intelligence** means intelligence that is created by humans and built into machines, especially computers. It's teaching computers to do things that normally require human intelligence.

## A Simple Way to Think About AI

Imagine teaching a child to recognize animals. You show them pictures of dogs and say "dog" each time. After seeing many dogs, the child learns to recognize dogs they've never seen before. They understand what makes a dog a dog, even if it's a different breed or color.

AI works in a similar way. We show a computer program thousands of pictures of dogs and tell it "these are dogs." The program learns patterns, like dogs have four legs, fur, and certain facial features. Eventually, the program can identify dogs in new pictures it has never seen before.

This is the heart of AI: machines learning from examples and using that knowledge to make decisions or predictions.
