# Chapter 4: Types of AI

AI experts often talk about two types of AI:

**Narrow AI (or Weak AI)**: This is AI that's designed to do one specific task really well. Your email spam filter, voice assistant, and Netflix recommendations are all narrow AI. This is the only type of AI that exists today. Each system is specialized for its particular job.

**General AI (or Strong AI)**: This would be AI that can do any intellectual task that a human can do. It could learn any skill, understand any concept, and apply knowledge across different areas. This type of AI does not exist yet and may not exist for many decades, if ever.

When people talk about AI today, they're talking about narrow AI—tools that are very good at specific jobs.

## Why Should You Care About AI?

AI is not just a technology of the future. It's here now, affecting your life in dozens of ways every day:

- It helps doctors diagnose diseases earlier and more accurately
- It makes your online shopping faster by predicting what you're looking for
- It helps banks detect fraud and protect your money
- It makes traffic flow better by adjusting traffic lights based on real-time conditions
- It helps farmers grow more food with less water and pesticides

Understanding AI helps you make better decisions about privacy, job choices, and how you use technology. It helps you tell the difference between real AI capabilities and exaggerated claims. And it might even inspire you to create AI solutions to problems you care about.
