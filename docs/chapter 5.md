# Chapter 5: Summary

Let's review what we've learned:

- **AI means teaching computers to do tasks that require human-like intelligence**, such as learning, understanding, and problem-solving
- **AI learns from examples**, much like how children learn by seeing many instances of something
- **AI is already part of your daily life** in email filters, search engines, navigation apps, and recommendation systems
- **AI is a tool, not a conscious being** that works through mathematics and programming
- **Narrow AI** (specialized for one task) is what exists today, while **General AI** (human-like intelligence) remains theoretical
- **Understanding AI matters** because it affects your privacy, career, and daily decisions

## Looking Ahead

Now that you understand what AI is at a basic level, you might be wondering: How does AI actually learn? What makes it work? In the next chapter, we'll explore how AI learns from data and the different ways machines can be taught new skills.

You don't need to be a programmer or mathematician to understand these concepts. We'll continue using simple language and everyday examples to make everything clear.

Welcome to your AI learning journey!
